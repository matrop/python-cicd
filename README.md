## ToDo
- Read up on best practices for building and pushing Docker Images in CICD Pipelines 
    - e.g. do I always push image or just on PR? How to name images?
- Implement Image Pushing
- Create Terraform scripts to deploy Docker image on Azure
- Create pipeline to setup infrastructure using Terraform scripts
- Create (separate?) pipeline to run continuous delivery on newly setup infrastructure
